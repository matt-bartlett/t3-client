# t3

> Front-end interface to consume the T3 API

## Build Setup

``` bash

npm run build --report

## Todos
- [ ] - API call error catching
- [ ] - Play track previews
- [ ] - Responsivity (mobile, tablets, etc)
- [ ] - Simplify Vuex structure - While current structure is good for a larger application, its overkill for this
