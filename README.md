# T3

VueJS client for consuming the T3 API

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

## Server configuration
Since we're using HTML5 history mode, you'll need to add this to your host/.htaccess file:
https://router.vuejs.org/en/essentials/history-mode.html

## Todos
- [ ] - Implement pre-rendering for images
- [ ] - Play track previews
- [ ] - Simplify Vuex structure
- [ ] - Vuex Actions/Mutations can be tidier
